Feature: Secure Google Compute Autoscaler Configuration

  Scenario: Preventing Autoscaler from Scaling to Excessive Instances (Resource Exhaustion)
    Given a Terraform configuration for a google_compute_autoscaler resource with a max_num_replicas of 1000
    And the autoscaler is configured with a CPU utilization metric
    When the CPU utilization remains consistently high
    Then the autoscaler should NOT scale beyond a predefined, reasonable maximum number of replicas (e.g., 50), preventing resource exhaustion.
    And the Terraform configuration should include explicit limits on max_num_replicas, documented with security rationale.


  Scenario: Ensuring Autoscaler Uses Appropriate Target Pools (Unauthorized Access)
    Given a Terraform configuration for a google_compute_autoscaler resource targeting a specific instance group manager
    And the instance group manager contains instances with specific firewall rules
    When the autoscaler scales up
    Then the new instances created should inherit the same firewall rules and only have access to authorized resources.
    And the Terraform configuration should explicitly define and reference the target instance group manager, preventing accidental targeting of insecure pools.


  Scenario: Preventing Autoscaler from Scaling Down Below Minimum Required Instances (Denial of Service)
    Given a Terraform configuration for a google_compute_autoscaler resource with a min_num_replicas of 2
    And the autoscaler is configured with a CPU utilization metric
    When the CPU utilization drops significantly
    Then the autoscaler should NOT scale below the minimum number of replicas (2), preventing denial of service.
    And the Terraform configuration should include a well-justified minimum number of replicas, considering application requirements and potential traffic spikes.


  Scenario: Securely Configuring Autoscaler Cooling Period (Unintended Resource Consumption)
    Given a Terraform configuration for a google_compute_autoscaler resource
    When the autoscaler is configured with a short cooling period
    Then the autoscaler should have a cooling period long enough to prevent rapid, uncontrolled scaling fluctuations and unnecessary resource consumption.
    And the Terraform configuration should justify the chosen cooling period value with comments explaining the rationale.


  Scenario: Using IAM Roles with Least Privilege for Autoscaler (Privilege Escalation)
    Given a Terraform configuration for a google_compute_autoscaler resource
    When the autoscaler is configured with an IAM service account
    Then the service account should only have the necessary permissions to manage the autoscaler and its associated resources, adhering to the principle of least privilege.
    And the Terraform configuration should explicitly define the IAM roles and permissions granted to the service account, with clear justification for each permission.


  Scenario: Monitoring Autoscaler Metrics for Anomalies (Security Threats)
    Given a Terraform configuration for a google_compute_autoscaler resource
    And monitoring is set up for relevant autoscaler metrics (e.g., number of instances, CPU utilization)
    When unusual scaling behavior is detected (e.g., rapid scaling up or down)
    Then alerts should be triggered to notify security personnel, enabling timely investigation and response to potential security threats or misconfigurations.
    And the Terraform configuration should include references to the monitoring setup and alert configurations.

Feature: Secure Google Compute Instance Template Configuration

  Scenario: Preventing Publicly Accessible Instances
    Given a Terraform configuration for a google_compute_instance_template resource named "default"
    And the network interface has a network specified
    And the network interface does not have any accessConfigs specified
    When the Terraform configuration is applied
    Then the created instance template should not have any publicly accessible IP addresses.
    And the instance template should only allow internal network access.


  Scenario: Enforcing SSH Key Restrictions
    Given a Terraform configuration for a google_compute_instance_template resource named "default"
    And the metadata contains SSH keys
    And the SSH keys are restricted to specific users or patterns
    When the Terraform configuration is applied
    Then the created instance template should only allow SSH access from the specified keys.
    And the instance template should reject SSH connections from unauthorized keys.


  Scenario: Preventing Unnecessary Metadata
    Given a Terraform configuration for a google_compute_instance_template resource named "default"
    And the metadata includes only necessary information for the application
    And sensitive information is excluded from the metadata
    When the Terraform configuration is applied
    Then the created instance template should only contain essential metadata.
    And sensitive information should not be present in the instance template metadata.


  Scenario: Using Managed Instance Groups for Scalability and Security
    Given a Terraform configuration for a google_compute_instance_template resource named "default"
    And the instance template is associated with a managed instance group (MIG)
    And the MIG has appropriate autoscaling policies and health checks
    When the Terraform configuration is applied
    Then the created instance template should be managed by a MIG.
    And the MIG should ensure high availability and automatic scaling.
    And the MIG should perform health checks to remove unhealthy instances.


  Scenario: Applying appropriate service accounts with least privilege
    Given a Terraform configuration for a google_compute_instance_template resource named "default"
    And a service account is specified for the instance template
    And the service account has only the necessary permissions to perform its tasks
    When the Terraform configuration is applied
    Then the created instance template should use the specified service account.
    And the service account should have only the least privilege necessary.


  Scenario: Ensuring Disk Encryption
    Given a Terraform configuration for a google_compute_instance_template resource named "default"
    And the attached disks are configured with encryption using Google managed keys (CMK) or customer managed keys (CMK)
    When the Terraform configuration is applied
    Then all attached disks in the created instance template should be encrypted.
    And the encryption keys should be properly managed and rotated according to security best practices.


  Scenario:  Preventing Boot Disk Snapshots from being Publicly Accessible
    Given a Terraform configuration for a google_compute_instance_template resource named "default"
    And a boot disk is specified
    And the boot disk is not configured to create public snapshots
    When the Terraform configuration is applied
    Then the boot disk should not automatically create publicly accessible snapshots.

Feature: Secure Google Compute Instance Group Manager Configuration

  Scenario: Preventing Unintentional Public IP Assignment
    Given a Terraform configuration for a google_compute_instance_group_manager named "my-igm"
    And the instance template specifies a network interface with no specified accessConfigs
    When the Terraform configuration is applied

  Scenario: Ensuring Instance Group Manager Uses a Private Network
    Given a Terraform configuration for a google_compute_instance_group_manager named "my-igm"
    And the instance template specifies a network interface connected to a VPC network named "my-private-vpc"
    And the "my-private-vpc" network is configured as a private network (no public IP gateway)
    When the Terraform configuration is applied
    Then the created instances should only have internal IP addresses.


  Scenario: Enforcing HTTPS for Instance Group Manager Health Checks
    Given a Terraform configuration for a google_compute_instance_group_manager named "my-igm"
    And a health check is defined with a HTTP protocol
    When the Terraform configuration is applied
